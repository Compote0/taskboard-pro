      <h2>Built with Angular</h2>
      <p>
        This application is built using Angular, one of the most powerful and popular frameworks
        for building modern web applications. We leverage Angular's reactive programming capabilities,
        standalone components, and lazy loading to deliver a fast and efficient user experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        The application demonstrates best practices in Angular development, including component-based
        architecture, service injection, and reactive state management using RxJS BehaviorSubject.
